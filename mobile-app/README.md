## Mushroom Master Application

This directory contains the source code for the Flutter app.

Most of the written code is in the `lib` directory, which has the app logic and UI, and the `test` directory, which has unit tests that you can run with `flutter test`. The `assets` directory contains the Deep Learning model `.tflite` file, the `labels.txt` file with the names for each mushroom the model can identify, and the `fungi_species.db` file with the mushroom information used in the Field Guide.

The rest of the code in this directory is mostly auto‑generated by Flutter for the platforms the app runs on. I’ve tweaked some of it for permissions and build settings.

### Quick start

- Prereqs: Flutter (stable), Android SDKs; Xcode if targeting iOS.
- Install deps:
  ```
  flutter pub get
  ```
- Run:
  ```
  flutter run
  ```
- Tests:
  ```
  flutter test
  ```


### Directory layout

- `lib/` — Flutter UI and logic. For example, the bottom nav is in [`lib/navigation/nav_bar.dart`](lib/navigation/nav_bar.dart).
- `test/` — Flutter tests.
- `assets/` — the `.tflite` model, `labels.txt`, and the local `fungi_species.db`.
- `android/`, `ios/`, `web/` — platform scaffolding.

### Building

- Android:
  ```
  flutter build apk
  ```
- iOS:
  ```
  cd ios
  pod install
  cd ..
  flutter build ios
  ```
